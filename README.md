### Install Instructions

If you would like to download the code and try it for yourself:

1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/jforaker/react-links-isomorphic.git`
2. Install packages: `npm install`
3. Launch: `node server.js`
4. Visit in your browser at: `http://localhost:3000`
5. To see serverside rendering, comment out main.js from the /views/index.ejs file. This will show what is rendered purely from the server side.

Build and watch changes with `gulp` in a second tab
